# Assignment: T5: Buggy Fruit
# Purpose: A flawed program which uses a function to determine the area of a circle
# There are several problems with this code. Use the debugger to find them.
#
# Background:
# The area of a circle is the number of square units inside that circle.
# a formula for this area is a = PI * r**2 where PI is an irrational number
# approximated by PI=3.141592
