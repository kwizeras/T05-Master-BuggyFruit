# Assignment: T04: Unit Testing
#
# Purpose: Demonstrates the use of division and modulus operations.
#
# This program INCORRECTLY calculates the largest number of
# quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies needed to make that change in coins.
# It is designed to show a subtle error and the value of unit tests.

    This function looks like it should take a floating point number to_change
    and return a list of how much change to give as [num_quarters, num_dimes, num_nickels, num_pennies]

    However, it compounds small truncation errors of the floating point arithmetic.
    Such errors are subtle and can be quite hard to debug, so unit tests are useful!
    A better algorithm would be to use integers instead of floats,
    but the point of this assignment is NOT to fix the error.
    It IS to help you learn to use and to value unit tests.
